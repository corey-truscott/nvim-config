# nvim-config
my neovim configuration

# installation script
it is recommended you use a posix compliant shell to run this such as dash, but it doesnt matter too much.
```sh
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corey-truscott/nvim-config/main/install.sh)
```

# window transparency
if you want neovim to be transparent, use the command `:TransparentToggle`
